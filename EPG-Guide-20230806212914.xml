<desc lang="en">Hailed as "the funniest thing on Canadian television since 'The Kids in the Hall,'" the award-winning "Baroness von Sketch Show" premieres to a U.S. audience courtesy of IFC. The all-female comedy series is created by and stars veteran Canadian actor Meredith MacNeill and Second City alumni Carolyn Taylor, Aurora Browne and Jennifer Whalen, who satirize modern life's everyday concerns, from the pretentiousness of ordering a fancy coffee to office and sexual politics. Other popular skits include a riff on being relegated to the over-40 section of a gym locker room, and a theory of what a women-only leadership summit would be like.</desc>

<title lang="en" >Mysteries of the Abandoned</title>
<desc lang="en">Scattered around the world are long-forgotten engineering marvels, decaying cities and empty factories that once stood on the cutting edge of design and construction. Today they are discarded, dangerous, and some of them are even deadly. "Mysteries of the Abandoned" reveals why these engineering triumphs were built and how they were left to crumble. In each hourlong episode, stories tell of who originally designed the structure, its historical significance, and why it was ultimately no longer viable. California's Goat Canyon Trestle railway, Pennsylvania's Kinzua Viaduct steel bridge, the Grand Goulets Road in the French Alps, and Hashima Island, a once thriving and now deserted Japanese island, are among episode subjects.</desc>
